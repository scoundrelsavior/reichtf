</figure>

<div><p class="toptitle">Gathered Together In His Name</p></div>

<p>We are the chosen elite of Reich, our anointed leader, whose name we take as our own. We rely upon the divine guidance of His Eminence. Our family embraces a common cause and the belief that members of our privileged group possess a divine power within us that is the result of the intellectual and spiritual enlightenment instilled in us by our anointed Father.</p>

<p>The Reich Family is not a cult. That is not to say that our family is not a religious group. We address Reich using titles reserved for the clergy in other religions. Certain aspects of our practices, philosophies, and ceremonies are similar to those of the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the Church of Scientology, the Amish or Anabaptist Christianity, and Judaism. None amongst these religions are singularly central to our family. We do not pray to a mutual God as a group.</p>

<p>With that said, members are not required to forsake their own personal religions upon joining the Reich Family. A large percentage of those who come to us are Christian or Catholic in faith which is theirs to keep personally in their hearts. Each member's personal religious faith is privately held and respected by the family. The sharing of elements of a particular faith are welcomed although the religions privately held are not mutually practiced by the family as a whole. Fanaticism of one's religion is not allowed nor would we expect a fanatical religious person to have any interest in joining our family in the first place. Likewise, if new members can retain their own religious faiths upon joining, it is a testament to the fact that the Reich Family is not a fanatical religious group.</p>

<p>Reich often refers to Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha and other deities in his teachings. We refer to the life of Jesus on this page because we respect him and the great value of his teachings, his life, and his sacrificial death. Though we respect several religions and borrow certain elements from each of them, we guard against extreme religion. Religious fanaticism has been the downfall of many groups in the past. We have taken notice of the past catastrophes of other religious groups and guard against the elements that led to each group's demise.</p>

<p>Reich is our anointed earthly Father, whom we dearly love and deeply respect. He is the Supreme Head of our family. We rely upon the guidance and teachings of His Eminence. We exalt our leader but we do not worship Reich as our God. Our high regard for Reich is similar to the Roman Catholic's respect for their Cardinals, whom they also respectfully address with the Ecclesiastical title, <i>His Eminence</i> or <i>Your Eminence</i> when in the Cardinal's presence. Though Cardinals are esteemed clergy in the Roman Catholic Church, they are not worshipped as Gods by Roman Catholics. Similarly, Reich is not worshipped as the God of the Reich Family; nor is any other earthly man, woman, or child.</p>

<p>We have all pledged our properties and income to the family. This requires a great degree of trust which we all have in our beloved leader, Reich. We give all our earthly possessions to our family upon joining because we all want to live in the presence of His Eminence and reside in the loving arms of His Family. We autonomously provide for ourselves with the pooling of our bountiful resources and the collection of our professional talents. Our commitment and complete devotion to His Eminence and to His Family, coincides with a story from the life of Jesus, when he was approached by a rich young ruler who asked him what he must do to have eternal life.</p>

<p>In the 19<sup>th</sup> chapter of Matthew, Jesus responded to the rich young ruler, "If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven. Then come, follow me.” When the young man heard this, he went away grieving, for he possessed great wealth. Jesus then said to his disciples, "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the Kingdom of Heaven."</p>

<p>His disciple Peter then responded, “We have given up everything to follow you. What then will there be for us?” Jesus replied, “Amen, I say to you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man is seated on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will yourselves sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first." (Matthew 19, New Catholic Bible)</p>

<p>While it must be acknowledged that Jesus told the rich young ruler to give his wealth to the poor, our beloved leader is not Jesus. Reich cannot turn water into wine or multiply the loaves and fishes to feed every man, woman, and child present. Reich cannot grant us eternal life or offer us the Kingdom of Heaven. But he can grant us entrance into His Family. He can grace us with the presence of His Eminence so that we might be enlightened by his teachings and filled with His Infinite Wisdom. The blessings that come from being a part of the Reich Family and being in the presence of His Eminence, is more than enough to bring us great joy for a lifetime here on earth.</p>

<p>The Reich Family is not concentrated in high numbers in a single location. The family consists of multiple subgroups or chapters. The concept of smaller chapters, that are geographically spread apart, is based on the military tactic of Dispersal. In a defensive and protective sense, dispersal of the family into smaller groups or chapters reduces the likelihood of a decisive engagement with those who might wish to come against us. By distributing our family into smaller communal chapters, we can leverage geographic advantages while complicating our potential adversary’s targeting efforts.</p>

<p>The creation of smaller communal chapters comes with a number of other advantages. Smaller groups prevent overcrowding and economic overextension that can occur in a communal family that is concentrated in high numbers in a single location, greatly improving the family's quality of life. Smaller chapters that are geographically spread apart, protect the family's privacy. A large communal family, with a thousand or more people, concentrated in a single location, would create a spectacle. Chapters allow the family to easily blend into the general population without bringing undue attention to ourselves. From a logistical standpoint, smaller groups or chapters reduce the complications of movement that would be experienced if the family travelled in a single large group, bearing the same surname on our passports. Finally, the creation of smaller chapters allows for the family to more easily grow and internationally expand.</p>

<p>The Reich Family holds conservative political views. Because many of us are Americans, we have a continued interest in the politics of the United States. We do not revolve solely around American politics. We monitor politics internationally. As it pertains to United States politics, the Americans amongst us politically embrace most of the ideals of the US Republican Party. Though we agree with many of Republican President Donald Trump's policies and actions, we do not feel he represents a pure Republican Party viewpoint. We are not aligned with the extremist views of the current Republican Party. Conservatism is opposed to extremism. To be more precise, we are aligned with a Ronald Reagan Era Republican Party of the 1980's that expressed more conservative ideals than does the current, more radical views of the Donald Trump Era Republican Party.</p>

<p>Pertaining to the current Republican Party, we are aligned with their stance on illegal immigration. No other country in the world allows a constant influx of illegal immigrants, who simply can make their way across the land borders into America, to live and work in the country. The leftist Democratic Party embraces this as immigrants pursuing the American Dream. In the meantime, natural born American citizens struggle to attain that same American Dream. We are aligned with the current Republican Party's dream of rebuilding American nationalism. Most countries around the world express their national pride and make laws that specifically protect the interests of their country. We are aligned with the current Republican Party's opposition against Wokeism, same sex marriage, the promotion of LGBTQ amongst children and teens, and other views that attack the traditional family or views and movements that stoke racial tension.</p>

<p>Though we do not align with some of the actions of President Donald Trump, we support him and many actions he has undertaken as the 47th President of the United States. Members of the Reich Family vote absentee in American elections. We are all registered to vote as Republicans. We will continue to vote for the Republican Party's nominations for President, Representative, or Senator. The Republican Party stands for most of our practices and political beliefs. The Reich Family is a religious group with strong political views on the protection of our right to practice our religion and the perpetuation of the traditional family that the Republican Party embraces, promotes, and protects.</p>

<p>Our children are raised in a nurturing environment of love and guidance, as prescribed by our anointed Father. Our young children are the most protected ones on earth. They are not sent alone amongst strangers in the outside world who might pose a danger to them. We teach our youngest children within our family. Starting in grade five, our children attend parochial schools or moderate Christian schools in the community until they reach grade twelve. This is not ideal for us. We hope to someday be financially capable to build our own schools and hire our own teachers to staff them. Our children and teens are our priority. We give them our very best. We live to take care of them, to love them, and to protect them.</p>

<p>The celebration of The Coming of Age takes place for girls at the age of twelve and for boys at the age of thirteen in the Reich Family. It is modeled after the Jewish tradition of Bat Mitzvah and Bar Mitzvah. Bat mitzvah is Hebrew for “daughter of commandment.” When a Jewish girl turns 12, she has all the rights and obligations of a Jewish adult, including the commandments of the Torah. From that date, she takes her place in the Jewish community. This milestone, called a bat mitzvah, is often celebrated with creative projects, meaningful gatherings and joyous parties (<a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1918218/jewish/Bat-Mitzvah-What-It-Is-and-How-to-Celebrate.htm" target="_blank">Bat Mitzvah: What It Is and How to Celebrate a Jewish Girl's Coming of Age</a>). Bar mitzvah is Hebrew for “son of commandment.” When a Jewish boy turns 13, he has all the rights and obligations of a Jewish adult, including the commandments of the Torah. From that date, he will wear tefillin on a daily basis, participate in synagogue services and take his place in the Jewish community. This milestone—called a bar mitzvah—is often celebrated with a ceremony in synagogue, tefillin wearing, and parties. The celebrant may be called to the Torah, lead services, deliver a speech or otherwise demonstrate his newfound status (<a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1912609/jewish/Bar-Mitzvah-What-It-Is-and-How-to-Celebrate.htm" target="_blank">Bar Mitzvah: What It Is and How to Celebrate a Jewish Boy's Coming of Age</a>). The Reich Family's philosophies and celebrations of The Coming of Age for our youth are similar but not completely aligned with that of the Jewish religion. For instance, we regard girls to the same degree of importance as boys as it pertains to more serious roles in the Family after their Coming of Age.</p>

<p>When a girl in the Reich Family turns 12, she has all the rights and obligations of an adult. When a boy in the Reich Family turns 13, he has all the rights and obligations of an adult. From that date, girls and boys take on serious roles and responsibilities in the Reich Family. Our youth recognize that they are now responsible for following the laws of the Reich Family, having reached the age of accountability for their actions and deeds. There is a higher expectation of their contributions to the Family. They now serve as positive role models for the children in the Reich Family. The Coming of Age is the start of the family showing these wonderful young people the respect that is due them as young adults amongst us. At this point, our young adults are granted the power to vote on the most important issues in the family, including the power to vote on the acceptance or rejection of new members into the Reich Family. Teens in the Reich Family are not considered children who are seen but not heard. Instead, they have a strong voice in the governance of the Family.</p>

<p>In a separate ceremony, subsequent to the celebration of the Coming of Age, our youth take the Vow of Purity which reads as follows. "I, (Full Name), a faithful (Daughter or Son) of the Reich Family, vow to His Eminence Reich, to Almighty God, to my future spouse and to myself, to remain pure in mind and body for the spouse God has planned for me, so that when I enter the Sacrament of Matrimony, I will be able to give myself to (Him or Her) with a completely pure conscience. And if it should be that I should not marry, I vow to remain pure to honour the Teachings of His Eminence and to honour my Temple, which was created in the Image of Almighty God (Signed, Dated, Witnessed). View the <a href="/images/vowofpuritydaughter.png" target="_blank">Vow of Purity for Girls</a> and the <a href="/images/vowofpurityson.png" target="_blank">Vow of Purity for Boys</a>. These documents are based on the Vow of Purity document presented to Catholic youth.</p>

<p>A Vow of Purity would not be understood if our youth had never been educated in the area of human sexuality. Human sexuality education for our children and teens is based on the guidelines suggested by the Committee on Education of the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops and published in Human Sexuality - A Catholic Perspective for Education and Lifelong Learning [USCC, 1990]. We adhere to the teaching document from the Vatican by the Pontifical Council on the Family, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_08121995_human-sexuality_en.html" target="_blank">The Truth and Meaning of Human Sexuality: Guidelines for Education within the Family</a> of 1996. More details on the matter of human sexuality education in the Catholic Church can be found at the Catholic Education Resource Center in an article by Kenneth D. Whitehead titled, <a href="https://catholiceducation.org/en/marriage-and-family/sex-education-the-vatican-s-guidelines.html" target="_blank">Sex Education: The Vatican’s Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>The following checklists for Reich Family parents, concerning what each age group should know about human sexuality, are categorized as <a href="https://files.ecatholic.com/5554/documents/2017/9/HO-SexChecklist%20YoungChilre.cwk%20WP.pdf?t=1504622395000" target="_blank">Early Childhood (Birth to Age 6)</a>, <a href="https://files.ecatholic.com/5554/documents/2017/9/HO-SexChecklist%20OlderChild.cwk%20WP.pdf?t=1505318243000" target="_blank">Childhood (Ages 7 to 11)</a>, <a href="https://files.ecatholic.com/5554/documents/2017/9/HO-SexChecklist%20YoungTeens.cwk%20WP.pdf?t=1505318134000" target="_blank">Early Adolescence (Ages 12 to 15)</a>, and <a href="https://files.ecatholic.com/5554/documents/2017/9/HO-SexChecklistOlderTeencwk.cwk%20WP.pdf?t=1504622458000" target="_blank">Adolescence (Ages 13 to 18)</a> (Courtesy of The Catholic Parishes in Waterloo, Faithful Parenting, St. John and St. Nicholas Religious Education Office, 1701 Mulberry Street, Waterloo IA 50703 and the <a href="https://waterloocatholics.org/catholic-parents-guide-to-formation-in-human-sexuality" target="_blank">Waterloo Catholic Faith Formation</a>). To better understand these guides on human sexuality at each level of age development of children and teens, we quote the <a href="https://waterloocatholics.org/catholic-parents-guide-to-formation-in-human-sexuality" target="_blank">Waterloo Catholic Faith Formation</a>: "Over and over again, the Church has emphasized the parent’s role as the “first herald” or "first witness" of faith for children.  This responsibility as your child’s “first teacher” is especially important in the area of human sexuality. Your child’s spiritual growth and formation in faith is closely connected to his or her general development as a human person.  As your child grows, it is important to provide not only adequate information about religious and moral teachings, but also the information they need to develop physically, socially, psychologically and emotionally. This guide is designed to help you provide the necessary information your child needs in order to develop as a healthy, mature, and morally responsible sexual person.  It outlines the general characteristics of sexual development at various ages from birth to adulthood, and provides guidelines for what children need to know about sexuality at various age levels. The developmental descriptions and guidelines are adapted from Human Sexuality--A Catholic Perspective for Education and Lifelong Learning, an official document prepared by the United States Catholic Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Committee on Education and approved by the Catholic bishops of the United States. (© 1991, United States Catholic Conference of Bishops)" The Reich Family uses this Catholic framework alongside the Pontifical Council on the Family, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_08121995_human-sexuality_en.html" target="_blank">The Truth and Meaning of Human Sexuality: Guidelines for Education within the Family</a> of 1996, released by the Vatican, to educate our children and teens in the area of human sexuality.</p>

<p>The Reich Family believes that human sexuality education of our children and teens is primarily our responsibility as parents. We also respect human sexuality education that is provided by the parochial schools our youth attend starting in grade five. We closely monitor what is being taught in each school our youth attend to make certain that they adhere to the guidelines mentioned above. Sex education programs, such as the ones in public schools in America, are not teaching teens to abstain from sexual activity. Their focus is to reduce the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases by promoting the usage of contraceptives. Abstinence is secondary in their teaching approach as a possible but not a reasonable option, assuming that teens will have sex regardless of how they are taught. We completely disagree with this determination.</p>

<p>Human sexuality education is coupled with the moral implications of any sex act outside the Holy Bond of Matrimony. We teach our youth from 12 for girls and 13 for boys that sex outside of marriage is a grave sin and a violation of their human Temple, which we regard as an abomination to God Almighty in whose image they were created. We teach our youth who have Come of Age that a sex act is a sex act, whether committed with others or with one's self. They are taught that the definition of a sex act is not limited to consummation. The Catholic Catechism, which the Family is aligned with, states that “Fornication is gravely contrary to the dignity of persons and of human sexuality which is naturally ordered to the good of spouses and the generation and education of children” (CCC 2353) Our youth who have Come of Age understand all of this and have made a commitment to abstinence reflecting that understanding.</p>

<p>When our teens complete their secondary education, which occurs from the ages of 16 to 18, and have chosen a path for their future, they are free to leave us and go out into the world to attend university or to pursue the lives of their choice. We provide as much career and university guidance as we can prior to their decision. If our youth return to the Reich Family after university, or at any time in their lives after leaving us, we are so happy to have them back but any such return to the family is their choice. If they wish to stay out in the world, they are still loved and are welcome to return to the family for visits anytime they would like.</p>

<p>The practice of encouraging our teens to leave us at the end of their secondary education is similar to one practiced by the Amish. Rumspringa is a rite of passage for Amish youth, typically starting at age 16, during which they are allowed to explore the outside world and experience behaviors that are usually restricted in their community. This period helps them make informed decisions about whether to commit to the Amish faith or leave the community altogether. Rumspringa is a Pennsylvania German combination of two high German words. Rum is <i><b>raum</i></b> in high German which means <b><i>space</i></b>. Springa is <i><b>spring</i></b> in high German which means <i><b>to jump</i></b>. Together, the term Rumspringa, in the high German literal sense, means to jump around in open space.</p>

<p>The Reich Family is strongly opposed to the psychiatric profession, similar to the anti-psychiatry stance expressed by the Church of Scientology. We view psychiatry as a detriment to society and a pseudo science that offers no cures. The pharmaceutical side of psychiatry is a multi-billion dollar industry for big pharma along with psychiatrist and general practitioners who prescribe what we consider, poison. Psychiatrists and general practitioners distribute highly addictive drugs with unreal side effects that include suicidal and homicidal tendencies. These drugs are very powerful and highly addictive. A patient comes to their psychiatrist or general practitioner for help and are instead given drugs that start heavy addictions and a host of side effects that cause their single problem to compound into a massive nightmare. The pharmaceutical industry stands to profit billions off the misfortune of drug addicts of their own creation the world over.</p>

<p>"In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, mentally troubled patients were literally subjected to torture devices. Next it was ice baths and insulin shock. Then electroconvulsive therapy that caused broken teeth and bones as well as loss of memory and regression into comatose states. Next, it was prefrontal lobotomies with an ice pick through the eye socket. Today it is drugs" <a href="https://www.scientology.org/faq/scientology-in-society/why-is-scientology-opposed-to-psychiatric-abuses.html" target="_blank">Church of Scientology</a>. The Family fully agrees with this assessment. It is as if the world has some form of amnesia when it comes to the historical atrocities of the psychiatric profession that ran asylums until US President Ronald Reagan closed them in the 1980's. It might not have been quite as horrible as the experiments of Nazi Doctor Joseph Mengele but it was bad enough to be held against the psychiatric profession for good.</p>

<p>We believe that psychiatric labels twists a person's fate. It alters their lives to revolve around a label that psychiatry changes every few years at their politically correct whim. Lifetime psychiatric labels also give the recipient no hope of making a change in their lives. No person should be deprived of the ability to change or transform their lives because they have been given a debilitating psychiatric label and convinced by psychiatry that the label applies to them for the rest of their lives. The Family sees the marketing effort of psychiatry in ruining the lives of American youth who are searching for an identity. Psychiatry offers youth a psychiatric disorder label they can identify with that will last them for a lifetime of defeat.</p>

<p>The psychiatric label Autism once had a specific meaning in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. There was a set of criterion that the patient had to meet to be diagnosed with Autism. Eventually, psychiatry decided that such labels as Mildly/Moderately/Severely Retarded was not politically correct. They decided to take the specific diagnosis of Autism and create a "one size fits all" label known as Autistic Spectrum Disorder. The mental differences in patients who receive this label are vast. Irresponsibly, psychiatry loosely diagnoses a person as "being on the spectrum."</p>

<p>Whatever the label, recipients take them very seriously. A label means government assistance, a possible lifetime in a group home setting or psych ward, a lifetime of abusive and addictive drugs, and worse. What society once referred to using such terms as off color behavior or a bit strange, is now given the psychiatric label, Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Non-specific diagnoses are prohibitive in the world of medicine but psychiatry is not medicine. A person's life depends on a diagnosis. Special treatment applies to specialized diagnoses in the world of medicine, not some blanket diagnosis with no specific treatment.</p>

<p>The Reich Family holds the same views as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS or The Mormons) as to the importance of genealogical research. <a href="https://reich.tf/research" target="_blank">Reich Research</a> is a genealogical project of the Reich Family. The site serves as a depository for genealogical records, historical accounts, and memories of those who have passed. Genealogical research is conducted thoroughly using such resources as FamilySearch.org, JewishGEN, and more. Reich Research writes articles and memorials based on research documents that include but are not limited to: census records, marriage records, death certificates, military records, naturalization papers, ship manifests, and more. All memorials and articles are private and are intended only for family members and fellow researchers unless otherwise decided to be of great importance to the public historical record.</p>

<p>Our beloved Reich has endured an event similar to that of the scorn, ridicule, hatred, and abuse of Jesus prior to the crucifixion. We are ever vigilant of a possible Judas Iscariot amongst us, who might try to hand over our beloved Reich to the authorities to be hauled away in chains, much as Jesus was arrested and ultimately handed over to the Romans, leading to his conviction and crucifixion. As long as the Reich Family is alive and strong, we will prevent our anointed leader from a horrible fate. Unfortunately, we are without our beloved leader at times when he must be separated from us and hidden away. This is for the protection of Reich but also for the protection of the family. During these times of distance from us, he suffers in complete isolation without the loving embrace of his family, who is likewise deprived of the presence of His Eminence.</p>
