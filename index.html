<div><p class="toptitle">Gathered Together In His Name</p></div>

<p>We are the chosen elite of Reich, our anointed leader, whose name we take as our own. We rely upon the divine guidance of His Eminence. We are a communal family that embraces a common cause and the belief that members of our privileged group possess a divine power within us that is the result of the intellectual and spiritual enlightenment instilled in us by our anointed Father.</p>

<p>The Reich Family is a commune; not a cult. The Cambridge Dictionary defines the term commune as a group of families or single people who live and work together, sharing possessions and responsibilities. We treasure our existence and work hard to maintain the best life for ourselves and our children.</p>

<p>Members are not required to forsake their own personal religions upon joining the Reich Family. A large percentage of those who come to us are Christian in faith which is theirs to keep personally in their hearts. We do practice the separation of religion and family in governing our commune. In other words, we do not mix the private religious beliefs of our members with the running of our Family.</p>

<p>Reich often refers to Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha and other deities in his teachings. We refer to the life of Jesus on this page because we respect Him and the great value of His teachings, His life, and His sacrificial death. There is no centralised religion at the heart of this family. Extreme religion in group settings can breed fanaticism and worse. This has been the downfall of many groups in the past. We have taken notice of the past catastrophes of other communal group efforts and guard against the elements that led to each group's demise.</p>

<p>Reich is our anointed earthly Father, whom we dearly love and deeply respect. He is the supreme Head of our Family. We rely upon the guidance and teachings of His Eminence. However, we do not worship Reich as our God. There are identical similarities between our exaltation of Reich and the Catholic Church's exaltation of the Pope. As the Pope is not the God of Catholics, Reich is not the God of the Reich Family.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we do not worship any of our young girls as our God. We exalt our young girls, at the age of nine, in the Ceremony of Exaltation. This ceremony is comparable to how the Catholic Church devotes their little girls in a symbolic marriage to Christ, in the ceremony of The First Holy Communion. The Ceremony of Exaltation is one of honour, goodness, and purity and should garner the same respect as the Catholic ceremony of The First Holy Communion.</p>

<p>There are other ceremonies that our children participate in during their youth. The Ceremony of The Coming of Age is celebrated for girls at the age of twelve and for boys at the age of thirteen. It is modeled after the Jewish tradition of the Mitzvahs. In the Jewish faith, at the time of the Mitzvah, boys and girls recognize that they are now responsible for following Jewish law. The youth of the Reich Family who participate in the Ceremony of The Coming of Age have reached the age of accountability for their actions and deeds. There is a higher expectation of their contributions to the Reich Family. Our youth realise that they will be expected to fulfill a higher degree of responsibility than they were expected to fulfill as children. It is the celebration of passing from childhood to adulthood or, as the title describes it, The Coming of Age.</p>

<figcaption>We pledge to protect His Eminence and our family in safer countries around the world, far from the hostile environment in the United States that exists for our anointed Father. (Justin Woodhouse / Schweiz)</figcaption>
</div>

<p>We have all pledged our properties and income to the family. This requires a great degree of trust which we all have in our beloved leader, Reich. We give all our earthly possessions to our family upon joining because we all want to live in the presence of His Eminence and reside in the loving arms of His family. We autonomously provide for ourselves with the pooling of our bountiful resources and the collection of our professional talents. Our commitment and complete devotion to His Eminence and to His Family, coincides with a story from the life of Jesus, when He was approached by a rich young ruler who asked Him what he must do to have eternal life.</p>

<p>In the 19<sup>th</sup> chapter of Matthew, Jesus responded to the rich young ruler, "If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven. Then come, follow me.” When the young man heard this, he went away grieving, for he possessed great wealth. Jesus then said to his disciples, "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the Kingdom of Heaven." His disciple Peter then responded, “We have given up everything to follow you. What then will there be for us?” Jesus replied, “Amen, I say to you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man is seated on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will yourselves sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first." (Matthew 19, New Catholic Bible)</p>

<p>While it must be acknowledged that Jesus told the rich young ruler to give his wealth to the poor, our beloved leader is not Jesus. Reich cannot turn water into wine or multiply the loaves and fishes to feed every man, woman, and child present. Reich is an earthly being who was created in the image of God, yet he cannot be God. Reich cannot grant us eternal life. Reich cannot offer us the Kingdom of Heaven. But He can grant us entrance into His Family here on earth. He can grace us with the presence of His Eminence so that we might be enlightened by his teachings which will fill us with His Infinite Wisdom that will grant us a better life here on earth. Once we enter into the Reich Family, we realise the great dividends that we receive when we give all of our earthly possessions and provide our every talent. Although our reward for giving our all will not result in eternal life, as the rich young ruler desired from Jesus, the blessings that come from being a part of the Reich Family and being in the presence of His Eminence, is more than enough to bring us great joy for a lifetime here on earth. Our dedication and undying devotion to our anointed Father and to the Reich Family is worth every sacrifice and every act of diligence.</p>

<p>Our children are raised in a nurturing environment of love and guidance, as prescribed by our anointed Father, Reich. We feel that our children are the most protected ones on earth. They are not sent amongst the strangers in the outside world who might pose a danger to them. Education is the most important factor of empowering children. We teach our children within our commune. We incorporate outside sources of education such as the resources for home schooling found on the Internet. Technology is important to us all and is taught to our children from a very early age. Aside from academics, our children's many talents are nurtured and encouraged through a range of teaching experiences that enhance the areas of art, music, dramatic acting, or any other area of creative expression.</p>

<figcaption>Rumspringa is a rite of passage for Amish youth, typically starting at age 16, during which they are allowed to explore the outside world. (Photorealistic Rendering Designed by Reich)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the same way that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS), or The Mormons, place an emphasis on their youth members discovering their familial heritage, the Reich Family does the same. We teach our youth how to effectively research their genealogical history using online tools. The majority of these genealogical sites were diligently created by LDS over the years. Our youth are taught how to conduct thorough heritage investigations based on research documents that include but are not limited to: census records, marriage records, death certificates, military records, naturalization papers, ship manifests, and more. These valuable resources can tell the story of their ancestors. Each young person is required to trace their ancestry back as many generations as is possible, using the genealogical tools that we teach them how to use.</p>

<p>We have high expectations of our youth and hope the best for their futures. When our children reach the age of adulthood, they are free to leave us and go out into the world to pursue the life of their choice. We encourage outside university attendance after the secondary education that we provide. If our children return to the Reich Family after university or at any time in their lives, we are so happy to have them back; however, any such return to the family is their choice. If they wish to stay out in the world, they are still loved and are welcome to return to the family for visits anytime they would like. This practice is according to the teachings of His Eminence.</p>

<p>The practice of allowing our youth to leave us as young adults is a similar practice to the Amish religion's Rumspringa. Rumspringa is a rite of passage for Amish youth, typically starting at age 16, during which they are allowed to explore the outside world and experience behaviors that are usually restricted in their community. This period helps them make informed decisions about whether to commit to the Amish faith or leave the community altogether. The Reich Family has no official name for our own practice of allowing our youth to launch out into the world. Leaving the Reich Family in such a fashion is not reserved only to our youth. Persons of any age can come and go freely.</p>

<p>The Reich Family is sometimes forced to change locations as a protective measure. Our location is never disclosed to the public, to further ensure the privacy and safety of our family. There has never been any consideration to live in the United States of America because of the legal and social climate that exists there for our leader. We pledge to protect His Eminence and our family in safer countries around the world, far from the hostile environment in the United States that exists for our anointed Father.</p>

<p>Our beloved Reich has endured an event similar to that of the scorn, ridicule, hatred, and abuse of Jesus prior to the crucifixion. We are ever vigilant of a possible Judas Iscariot amongst us, who might try to hand over our beloved Reich to the authorities to be hauled away in chains, much as Jesus was arrested and ultimately handed over to the Romans, that led to his conviction and crucifixion. As long as the Reich Family is alive and strong, we will prevent our anointed leader from a horrible fate. Unfortunately, we are without our beloved leader at times when he must be separated from us and hidden away. This is for the protection of Reich but also for the protection of the family. During these times of distance from us, he suffers in complete isolation without the loving embrace of his family.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:-20px;">We are the Reich Family. We are devoted to an autonomous existence based on the bounties of our collective professional and monetary contributions to the good of our commune. We are immersed in the body of our family, allowing us to express our eternal love and loyalty, one to another. Friends, supporters, and those interested in joining us are always welcome at our table.</p>
