<div><p class="toptitle">Gathered Together In His Name</p></div>

<p>We are the chosen elite of Reich, our anointed leader, whose name we take as our own. We rely upon the divine guidance of His Eminence. We are a communal family that embraces a common cause and the belief that members of our privileged group possess a divine power within us that is the result of the intellectual and spiritual enlightenment instilled in us by our anointed Father.</p>

<p>The Reich Family is a commune; not a cult. The Cambridge Dictionary defines the term commune as a group of families or single people who live and work together, sharing possessions and responsibilities. We treasure our existence and work hard to maintain the best life for ourselves and our children.</p>

<p>There is no centralized religion at the core of our commune. Even so, members are not required to forsake their own personal religions upon joining the Reich Family. A large percentage of those who come to us are Christian or Catholic in faith which is theirs to keep personally in their hearts. We do practice the separation of religion and family in governing our commune. In other words, we do not mix the private religious beliefs of our members with the running of our Family.</p>

<p>Reich often refers to Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha and other deities in his teachings. We refer to the life of Jesus on this page because we respect him and the great value of his teachings, his life, and his sacrificial death. As earlier stated, there is no centralised religion at the heart of this family. Extreme religion in group settings can breed fanaticism and worse. This has been the downfall of many groups in the past. We have taken notice of the past catastrophes of other communal group efforts and guard against the elements that led to each group's demise.</p>

<p>Reich is our anointed earthly Father, whom we dearly love and deeply respect. He is the Supreme Head of our Family. We rely upon the guidance and teachings of His Eminence. We exalt our leader but we do not worship Reich as our God. There are identical similarities between our exaltation of Reich and the Catholic Church's exaltation of the Pope. As the Pope is not the God of Catholics, Reich is not the God of the Reich Family, nor is any other earthly man, woman, or child.</p>

<p>We have all pledged our properties and income to the family. This requires a great degree of trust which we all have in our beloved leader, Reich. We give all our earthly possessions to our family upon joining because we all want to live in the presence of His Eminence and reside in the loving arms of His Family. We autonomously provide for ourselves with the pooling of our bountiful resources and the collection of our professional talents. Our commitment and complete devotion to His Eminence and to His Family, coincides with a story from the life of Jesus, when he was approached by a rich young ruler who asked him what he must do to have eternal life.</p>

<p>In the 19<sup>th</sup> chapter of Matthew, Jesus responded to the rich young ruler, "If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven. Then come, follow me.” When the young man heard this, he went away grieving, for he possessed great wealth. Jesus then said to his disciples, "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the Kingdom of Heaven." His disciple Peter then responded, “We have given up everything to follow you. What then will there be for us?” Jesus replied, “Amen, I say to you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man is seated on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will yourselves sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first." (Matthew 19, New Catholic Bible)</p>

<p>While it must be acknowledged that Jesus told the rich young ruler to give his wealth to the poor, our beloved leader is not Jesus. Reich cannot turn water into wine or multiply the loaves and fishes to feed every man, woman, and child present. Reich cannot grant us eternal life or offer us the Kingdom of Heaven. But he can grant us entrance into His Family. He can grace us with the presence of His Eminence so that we might be enlightened by his teachings and filled with His Infinite Wisdom. The blessings that come from being a part of the Reich Family and being in the presence of His Eminence, is more than enough to bring us great joy for a lifetime here on earth.</p>

<p>Our children are raised in a nurturing environment of love and guidance, as prescribed by our anointed Father. Our young children are the most protected ones on earth. They are not sent alone amongst strangers in the outside world who might pose a danger to them. We teach our youngest children within our commune. Our children and teens are our priority. We give them our very best. We live to take care of them, to love them, and to protect them.</p>

<p>When our teens complete their secondary education, which occurs from the ages of 16 to 18, and have chosen a path for their future, they are free to leave us and go out into the world to attend university or to pursue the lives of their choice. We provide as much career and university guidance as we can prior to their decision. If our youth return to the Reich Family after university, or at any time in their lives after leaving us, we are so happy to have them back but any such return to the family is their choice. If they wish to stay out in the world, they are still loved and are welcome to return to the family for visits anytime they would like.</p>

<p>The practice of encouraging our teens to leave us at the end of their secondary education is similar to one practiced by the Amish. Rumspringa is a rite of passage for Amish youth, typically starting at age 16, during which they are allowed to explore the outside world and experience behaviors that are usually restricted in their community. This period helps them make informed decisions about whether to commit to the Amish faith or leave the community altogether. Rumspringa is a Pennsylvania German combination of two high German words. Rum is <i><b>raum</i></b> in high German which means <b><i>space</i></b>. Springa is <i><b>spring</i></b> in high German which means <i><b>to jump</i></b>. Together, the term Rumspringa, in the high German literal sense, means to jump around in open space.</p>

<p>The Reich Family holds the same views as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS or The Mormons) as to the importance of genealogical research. <a href="https://reichresearch.org" target="_blank">Reich Research</a> is a genealogical project of the Reich Family. The site serves as a depository for genealogical records, historical accounts, and memories of those who have passed. Genealogical research is conducted thoroughly using such resources as FamilySearch.org, JewishGEN, and more. Reich Research writes articles and memorials based on research documents that include but are not limited to: census records, marriage records, death certificates, military records, naturalization papers, ship manifests, and more. All memorials and articles are private and are intended only for family members and fellow researchers unless otherwise decided to be of great importance to the public historical record.</p>

<p>Our beloved Reich has endured an event similar to that of the scorn, ridicule, hatred, and abuse of Jesus prior to the crucifixion. We are ever vigilant of a possible Judas Iscariot amongst us, who might try to hand over our beloved Reich to the authorities to be hauled away in chains, much as Jesus was arrested and ultimately handed over to the Romans, leading to his conviction and crucifixion. As long as the Reich Family is alive and strong, we will prevent our anointed leader from a horrible fate. Unfortunately, we are without our beloved leader at times when he must be separated from us and hidden away. This is for the protection of Reich but also for the protection of the family. During these times of distance from us, he suffers in complete isolation without the loving embrace of his family, who is likewise deprived of the presence of His Eminence.</p>
