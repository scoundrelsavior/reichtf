<div class="sectionheadings titlelinesheadings">Both Family and Religion</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Reich Family is a Trinitarian based religious group, led by His Eminence Reich, whose name we take as our own. We share the belief that we were created in the Image of Almighty God and that the Holy Trinity is the ultimate Power of Heaven and Earth. Certain aspects of our religious philosophies and practices are similar to those of the Roman Catholic Church and Judaism. We also respect certain philosophies and practices of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the Church of Scientology, and the Amish or Anabaptist Christianity. We guard against extreme religion. Religious fanaticism has been the downfall of many groups in the past. We have taken notice of the past catastrophes of other religious groups and guard against the elements that led to each group's demise.</p>

<p>The Reich Family is not solely a religious group. We are a strong, thriving family. We live our lives, work, raise our children, manage our households, and meet practical needs. We follow the guidance of His Eminence on these everyday matters as shaped and confirmed through collective decision‑making that is sealed with a family-wide <a href="#government">democratic vote</a>. Day to day practices, household norms, and chapter policies are developed in a discussion phase, put to a family vote, and implemented by individual households and chapters assuring that any guidance reflects the will and needs of the whole Family.</p>

<p>Embracing our identity as members of the Reich Family involves a sacred commitment, beginning with the legal change of our surnames to the family name, Reich. This transformative act signifies a shared identity and a pledge to live collectively as one family and one religion. Just as Levi became Matthew upon accepting Jesus’ call <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+9%3A9&version=KJV" target="_blank">Matthew 9:9</a> and Saul transformed into Paul after his encounter with Christ, indicating a complete rebirth in his faith <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+9%3A1-19&version=KJV" target="_blank">Acts 9:1-19</a>, our adoption of the Reich name symbolizes a profound familial and religious transformation.</p>

<p>This practice reinforces the bonds that unite us, transforming our group into something greater than merely a religious organization. It emphasizes our dedication and devotion, one to the other, fostering genuine familial kinship. This unique tradition differentiates us from other religious groups throughout history, strengthening our identity as a cohesive family unit and deepening our individual sense of belonging and kinship. By embracing the Reich name, we become true sisters and brothers, fathers and mothers, interconnected not solely through our values and beliefs but also through authentic familial love.</p>

<p>The Reich Family is a small religious group of less than a thousand, consisting of approximately two hundred fifty children from infancy to eleven years old and one hundred fifty young adults aged twelve to eighteen. We are not concentrated in high numbers in a single location. The Family consists of multiple subgroups or chapters. A chapter is located in a single village or city and consists of several biological families and singles living in separate housing. Housing ranges from apartments to houses. Family chapters are located in different countries around the world.</p>

<p>Chapters come with a number of other advantages. Chapters prevent overcrowding and economic overextension that can occur in a communal family that is concentrated in high numbers in a single location, greatly improving the Family's quality of life. Chapters of biological families and singles living in separate housing grant us individual privacy. A large communal family, with a thousand or more people, concentrated in a single location, would create a spectacle within a community. Chapters allow the Family to easily blend into the general population without bringing undue attention to ourselves. From a logistical standpoint, chapters reduce the complications of movement that would be experienced if the Family travelled in a single large group, in which case all members would share the same surname on their travel documents, which might draw undue attention at international ports of entry. The creation of chapters allows for the Family to grow and internationally expand.</p>

<p>Reich is our anointed earthly Father, whom we dearly love and deeply respect. He is the Supreme Head of our family. We rely upon the guidance and teachings of His Eminence. We exalt our leader but we do not worship Reich as our God. Our high regard for Reich is similar to the Roman Catholic's respect for their Cardinals, whom they also respectfully address with the Ecclesiastical title, <i>His Eminence</i> or <i>Your Eminence</i> when in the Cardinal's presence. Though Cardinals are esteemed clergy in the Roman Catholic Church, they are not worshipped as Gods by Roman Catholics. Similarly, Reich is not worshipped as the God of the Reich Family; nor is any other earthly man, woman, or child.</p>

<div class="sectionheadings titlelinesheadings">The Family's Trinitarian Religion</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Reich Family practices a Trinitarian religion that is our own. We believe in the Holy Trinity, that is One Divine Essence, consisting of Three Distinct Persons: Almighty God the Father or Patris; Christ Jesus the Son or Filii; and the Holy Spirit or Spiritus Sancti. The Holy Trinity is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and eternal. Trinitarianism is not a polytheistic religion. The Holy Trinity does not consist of three separate gods. Instead, the Trinity is One Divine Essence in Three Persons.</p>

</div>

<p>Almighty God, the Father, or Patris is the Grand Designer or Creator of Heaven and Earth. Almighty God created us all in His Image. Almighty God is the Father of His Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus refers to his Father in Heaven, as a separate entity from Himself, on several different occasions throughout the New Testament. Jesus prayed to His Father while on earth, demonstrating a distinction between the Father and the Son. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206%3A9-10&version=KJV" target="_blank">Matthew 6:9-10</a> Jesus prayed, <span style="color:#990000;"><sup>9</sup> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. <sup>10</sup> Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</span> Jesus distinguished himself from His Father when he said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A2&version=KJV" target="_blank">John 14:2</a>, <span style="color:#990000;">In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</span> Numerous biblical references state that, after Christ's Ascension to Heaven, Jesus sits at the right hand of the Father. Those references include <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20110%3A1&version=KJV" target="_blank">Psalm 110:1</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022%3A44&version=KJV" target="_blank">Matthew 22:44</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016%3A19&version=KJV" target="_blank">Mark 16:19</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202%3A33-35&version=KJV" target="_blank">Acts 2:33-35</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%205%3A31&version=KJV" target="_blank">Acts 5:31</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%207%3A55-56&version=KJV" target="_blank">Acts 7:55-56</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208%3A34&version=KJV" target="_blank">Romans 8:34</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201%3A20&version=KJV" target="_blank">Ephesians 1:20</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203%3A1&version=KJV" target="_blank">Colossians 3:1</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201%3A3&version=KJV" target="_blank">Hebrews 1:3</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201%3A13&version=KJV" target="_blank">Hebrews 1:13</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%203%3A22&version=KJV" target="_blank">1 Peter 3:22</a>, and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%203%3A21&version=KJV" target="_blank">Revelation 3:21</a>. This concept supports Trinitarian theology by affirming the equal and distinctive nature of Almighty God, Christ Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, within One Divine Essence that is the Holy Trinity.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, the Son of Almighty God, or Filii is the Prince of Peace and the Blessed Saviour who died so that we might live. His teachings, while on earth, were that of love, forgiveness, and peace. His miraculous acts, while on earth, such as healing the sick, casting out demons, feeding the multitudes, turning water into wine, and raising the dead, proved that he was truly the Son of the Living God. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16&version=KJV" target="_blank">John 3:16</a> states, <span style="color:#008000;">For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</span> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053%3A4-6&version=KJV" target="_blank">Isaiah 53:4-6</a> states, <span style="color:#008000;"><sup>4</sup> Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. <sup>5</sup> But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. <sup>6</sup> All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</span> The Family is not solely focused on Jesus Christ as are many churches. We do not call ourselves Christians. Though we love and exalt Christ Jesus, He is not exalted above Almighty God or the Holy Spirit. We equally believe in, exalt, and love each of the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit or Spiritus Sancti endows us with supernatural Gifts of the Spirit. The nine gifts of the Holy Spirit are listed in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I%20Corinthians%2012%3A8-10&version=KJV" target="_blank">I Corinthians 12:8-10</a> as the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, faith, gifts of healing, the working of miracles, prophecy, discerning of spirits, different kinds of tongues, and the interpretation of tongues. We experience the Fruits of the Holy Spirit that are mentioned in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205%3A22-23&version=KJV" target="_blank">Galatians 5:22-23</a> as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. The Holy Spirit fills us with the knowledge and understanding of every aspect of Almighty God and Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit reveals the answers to the most complex questions we might have about our religion and life.</p>

<div class="sectionheadings titlelinesheadings">The Holy Writings of Our Religion</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Family considers the Old Testament and the New Testament, collectively known as the Holy Bible, to be the complete Holy Writings of our religion. The Holy Bible is the sacred Word of Almighty God that He inspired its authors to write as the eternal Living Word. Our interpretation of the Holy Bible is granted to us through the Illumination of the Holy Spirit that serves as a light that guides our path to understanding. The Illumination grants us the ability to apply the Holy Bible to our day to day lives. Our biblical interpretations prepare us for the life beyond the one we now experience on earth. The Holy Bible allows us to understand the historical foundation of our religion. We gain knowledge and understanding of the creation of the Heavens, the Earth, and humankind by Almighty God. The Holy Bible tells the story of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Holy Bible grants us knowledge and understanding of the presence, power, fruits, and gifts of the Holy Spirit. We learn of the works of such great men of Almighty God as Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, the Apostle Paul, and many others. The Old Testament and the New Testament collectively focus on all Three Persons of the Holy Trinity, fulfilling our Trinitarian religion. The first five books of the Old Testament are the same as The Torah, fulfilling the Judaic component of our religion.</p>

<p>The Family relies upon the Holy Writings of the Old Testament, with the first five books comparable to the Hebrew language version of The Torah. The Old Testament focuses on Almighty God, One of the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity. The first five books of the Old Testament that are the same as the Torah are the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The first five books of the Old Testament only differ from The Hebrew Torah by linguistic translation. We read the English version of the Old Testament. The Orthodox Jewish religion reads the original Hebrew language of The Torah. These language differences are often cited by Jewish Torah scholars and by Jewish Rabbis. The Family accepts the additional books of the Old Testament that are recognized in Christian traditions.</p>

<p>The Family relies upon the Holy Writings of The New Testament, otherwise known as the Christian Bible. The New Testament documents the teachings, life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The New Testament focuses on Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, Two of the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity. The New Testament allows us to understand the origins of the first nine Christian churches formed by the Apostle Paul in Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe, Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, Corinth and Ephesus. Though the Family is not a Christ centred religion, we value the work and wisdom that the Apostle Paul brought to the Christian movement. The Apostle Paul's work has been the basis for almost every Christian church over two millennia since Christ's death and resurrection. Jesus reminded us in his lifetime, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A17-20&version=NCB" target="_blank">Matthew 5:17-20</a>, <span style="color:#990000;"><sup>17</sup> Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have come not to abolish but to fulfil them. <sup>18</sup> Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not a single letter, not even a tiny portion of a letter, will disappear from the Law until all things have been accomplished. <sup>19</sup> Therefore, whoever breaks even one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be considered least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever observes these commandments and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <sup>20</sup> I tell you, if your righteousness does not exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</span></p>

<p>Our interpretation of the Holy Bible, through the Illumination of the Holy Spirit, is what differentiates us from other religions and them from us. Divisions within the Christian church were addressed by the Apostle Paul in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011%3A18-19&version=NCB" target="_blank">I Corinthians 11:18-19</a> when he said, <span style="color:#008000;"><sup>18</sup> To begin with, when you come together in your assembly, I hear that there are divisions among you, and to some extent I am inclined to believe it. <sup>19</sup> There must be such factions among you so that it will become clear to you which groups should be trusted.</span> The Apostle Paul called for unity within the Christian church in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I%20Corinthians%201%3A10&version=KJV" target="_blank">I Corinthians 1:10</a> saying, <span style="color:#008000;">Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</span></p>

<div class="sectionheadings titlelinesheadings">How the Family Prays</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Family believes in the power of prayer, in unity, to His Eminence Reich who intercedes on our behalf to the Holy Trinity. His Eminence possesses the Spiritual Gift of Faith, one of the nine Gifts of the Spirit described in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2012%3A4-11&version=KJV" target="_blank">I Corinthians 12:4-11</a>. We do not raise our prayers to His Eminence with the belief that he is greater than or a replacement for the Holy Trinity. We do not pray to our anointed Father Reich as our God. We pray to His Eminence that he might intercede on our behalf to Almighty God, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, through the Power of his Faith and Infinite Love for His Family. His Eminence lifts our prayers to the Heavens in Nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. While it is true that we can pray directly to the Holy Trinity, there is no power greater than the Gift of Faith and Infinite Love that we have witnessed in His Eminence Reich who intercedes to the Holy Trinity on our behalf.</p>

<p>To better understand the concept of intercessory prayer, we refer to how Catholics pray to the Saints and to Mother Mary for their intercession to a higher Holy Trinity. In the article, <a href="https://www.christianity.com/wiki/prayer/why-do-catholics-pray-to-saints-is-it-biblical.html">Why Do Catholics Pray to Saints? Is it Biblical?</a>, Veronica Olson Neffinger, a Content Editor for Salem Web Network, best explains why when she writes, "What may seem idolatrous and blasphemous to those who were raised in Protestant Evangelical families and churches, seems completely normal to Catholics. In the Catholic view, saints, those who have died with faith in Christ, can intercede for us. Although it may seem to many Protestants that Catholics are worshipping the saints or elevating them to a level with Christ, the official Catholic doctrine says praying to the saints is not worshipping them; rather, it is about intercession. Those, like Mary, the mother of Christ, are thought to be close to Jesus and so they have a particular power to go to God on behalf of those of us who are still in the midst of our earthly struggles. Prayer to Mary is a way of being drawn towards Jesus. Just as a Protestant might go to a pastor to say, ‘pray for me’ with the assumption that your pastor will point you to Jesus, so also a Catholic will pray to Mary with the confidence that she will direct us to the Lord Jesus. It is an act of intercession. Protestant and Catholic interpretation of these passages about intercession is that Protestants believe that <span style="color:#008000;">“For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus”</span> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim.%202%3A5&version=KJV" target="_blank">1 Tim. 2:5</a>) and that all Christians should pray directly to him when praying for one another, and he will then intercede for us with the Father. Catholics, on the other hand, believe that Jesus intercedes for us, but that other faithful believers can do so as well."</p>

<div class="sectionheadings titlelinesheadings">Protection From Our Enemies</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His Eminence is the Good Shepherd who has gathered us together to lead us; to guide us; to watch over us; and to protect us from all that might come against us. His Eminence is Strength and Power which he instils also in His Family. We believe it is our responsibility to protect our own, in strength and in unity. In the New Testament, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A10&version=KJV" target="_blank">John 10:10</a> says, <span style="color:#008000;">The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</span> The thief referred to in this passage is understood to be Satan, also known as the Devil or the Adversary. The thief also refers to any enemy that seeks to kill, steal, and destroy all that is precious and valued in one's life. In opposition to the ill will of Satan, Christ’s mission is to bring abundant life. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A11-16&version=KJV" target="_blank">John 10:11-16</a> describes Jesus as the Good Shepherd who gathers, leads, and protects His flock. The Family relies upon His Eminence as our Good Shepherd and prepares a defence against an adversary who might wish to kill, steal, and destroy our family. Almighty God does not expect his creations to lie down and let themselves be destroyed by the enemy, whether it is Satan or Man.</p>

<p>While imprisoned in Rome, around AD 60-62, the Apostle Paul was visited by his faithful disciple Timothy along with some of the members of the Christian church in Ephesus. They came seeking Paul’s advice on how to deal with the persecution and spiritual warfare they were suffering at the hands of their adversaries. Paul responded by writing a letter to the church in Ephesus which is recorded in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206%3A10-18&version=KJV" target="_blank">Ephesians 6:10-18</a> and says, <span style="color:#008000;"><sup>10</sup> Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. <sup>11</sup> Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. <sup>12</sup> For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. <sup>13</sup> Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. <sup>14</sup> Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; <sup>15</sup> And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; <sup>16</sup> Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. <sup>17</sup> And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: <sup>18</sup> Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.</span> The Reich Family will rise up, in the name of His Eminence, against any adversary, to defend our children, our religion, and our way of life.</p>

<p>While the Reich Family protects and defends its children, religious beliefs, and way of life, we do not seek vengeance against our enemies. We are never alone in our fight to protect and defend our family. Almighty God delivers His vengeance against our enemies, on our behalf. The Family has witnessed Almighty God's vengeance against our enemies over the years. Almighty God will grant us justice in His time. In the fifth book of the Torah, Moses shared the Holy Voice of Almighty God with the Israelites in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2032%3A35&version=KJV" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 32:35</a> that says, <span style="color:#008000;">To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.</span> To add to this great revelation of Almighty God's word through Moses, much later, the Apostle Paul wrote in the sixth book in the New Testament in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012%3A17-19&version=KJV" target="_blank">Romans 12:17-19</a>, <span style="color:#008000;"><sup>17</sup> Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. <sup>18</sup> If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. <sup>19</sup> Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.</span> These passages teach us that we are not to deliver our own vengeance against our enemies or attempt in any way to destroy them. At the same time, we are not to stand in the way of Almighty God to deliver His justice to those who have attacked his children. It is not for us to say that no bad thing should come to our enemies. It is for Almighty God to decide and deliver, in His due time, what that justice might be.</p>

<div id="tithing" style="margin:auto;">
<div class="sectionheadings titlelinesheadings">The Concept of Tithing</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We contribute financially and give of our time and talents to the Reich Family. It is a requirement that all individual members and biological family units are able to be financially self-sufficient in the provision of their own food, clothing, and shelter. Past this requirement, we pledge one tenth of our incomes to the Reich Family. The concept of tithing, or giving one tenth of one's possessions, is rooted in the Old Testament in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2014%3A20&version=KJV" target="_blank">Genesis 14:20</a> that says, <span style="color:#008000;">Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything.</span> Tithing, or giving one tenth, is an expression of faith in His Eminence and an act of stewardship to the Reich Family. We tithe to express our thankfulness of His Eminence and the Reich Family. Our tithe is evidence of our responsibility, one to another, and our contribution to the great work of the Reich Family. Tithing is an investment today to perpetuate the Reich Family for years to come. Aside from tithing, family members give of their talents freely to benefit the Reich Family. For example, if a family member is an attorney, they give freely of their time and talents, within reason, to assist members who have legal needs. Members are encouraged to donate real estate and will their estates to the Reich Family. Tithes and other donations collected from family members are used to expand the Kingdom of the Reich Family, make investments in real estate and other financial ventures, loan assistance to members of our family during times of emergency, and more.</p>

<p>We tithe and give freely of our time and talents to the Family upon joining because we all want to live in the presence of His Eminence and reside in the loving arms of His Family. We autonomously provide for ourselves with the pooling of our bountiful resources and the collection of our professional talents. Our commitment and complete devotion to His Eminence and to His Family, coincides with a story from the life of Jesus, when he was approached by a rich young ruler who asked him what he must do to have eternal life.</p>

<figcaption>Jesus responded to the rich young ruler in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019%3A21-30&version=NCB" target="_blank">Matthew 19:21-30</a>, <span style="color:#990000;"> <sup>21</sup> If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven.

<p>Jesus responded to the rich young ruler in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019%3A21-30&version=NCB" target="_blank">Matthew 19:21-30</a>, <span style="color:#990000;"> <sup>21</sup> If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven. Then come, follow me.</span> <sup>22</sup> When the young man heard this, he went away grieving, for he possessed great wealth. <sup>23</sup> Then Jesus said to his disciples, <span style="color:#990000;">Amen, I say to you, it will be difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup>24</sup> Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.</span></p>

<p><sup>27</sup> Then Peter said in reply, We have given up everything to follow you. What then will there be for us? <sup>28</sup> Jesus replied, <span style="color:#990000;">Amen, I say to you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man is seated on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will yourselves sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <sup>29</sup> And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more and will inherit eternal life. <sup>30</sup> But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.</span></p>

<p>While it must be acknowledged that Jesus told the rich young ruler to give his wealth to the poor, our beloved leader is not Jesus. Reich cannot turn water into wine or multiply the loaves and fishes to feed every man, woman, and child present. Reich cannot grant us eternal life or offer us the Kingdom of Heaven. But he can grant us entrance into His Family. He can grace us with the presence of His Eminence so that we might be enlightened by his teachings and filled with His Infinite Wisdom. The blessings that come from being a part of the Reich Family and being in the presence of His Eminence, is more than enough to bring us great joy for a lifetime here on earth.</p>

<div style="display:flex;">
<div id="government" style="margin:auto;">
<div class="sectionheadings titlelinesheadings">Government of the Family</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The government of the Reich Family is based on the concept of democracy consisting of sound leadership of an administrative hierarchy that was chosen by our Leader but voted into position by the Family. We discuss and then vote on every important issue within the Family, including new family membership. Girls from the age of twelve and boys from the age of thirteen, respected by the Family as having all the rights and obligations of adults, are given the power of the vote and are given a voice in the discussion phase. These young adults account for 15% of the total population of the Family. Every effort is made to prevent any one person, including our anointed Leader, or small group of persons from being in full control of the Family.</p>

<p>The Family governing structure is hierarchical with the administrative branch consisting of His Eminence serving as the Supreme Head of the Family and his Disciples serving as his consultants on the day to day best interests of the Family. The Disciples of His Eminence are twelve in number and are chosen by Reich; however, they are ultimately voted into their positions by the Family. The administrative branch is there to offer guidance and support if needed during decision making processes without forcing any influence or control over the Family. The administrative branch views the Family as the Supreme Governing Body with the ultimate power of their votes. Individual chapters are self-governing on issues that apply solely to their immediate local situations with the final approval granted by His Eminence after consulting with his Disciples. The Family as a whole is made aware of the issues of local chapters and offers advice and assistance if requested.</p>

<p>The decision making process in the Family progresses as follows. An issue is first presented to the Family as a whole or a local chapter. Afterward, we enter the discussion phase. This phase might last for several days depending on the issue. During the discussion phase, His Eminence might offer his opinion, concerns, and guidance on a limited basis. Once all voices are heard in the discussion phase, a vote is cast on the issue. There are three types of votes: a vote in favour, a vote against, or a vote in favour with reservation. The reservation is attached in writing to the vote for the Family to read. The Family's vote is then passed to His Eminence for his final approval. His Eminence consults with his Disciples during this final phase. His Eminence has the ultimate power to reject a Family vote or to ask that the vote return to the discussion phase though both cases are extremely rare due to his respect for the will of the Family.</p>

<div style="display:flex;">
<div id="political" style="margin:auto;">
<div class="sectionheadings titlelinesheadings">Political Beliefs of the Family</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Reich Family holds conservative political views. Because many of us are Americans, we have a continued interest in the politics of the United States. We do not revolve solely around American politics. We monitor politics internationally. As it pertains to United States politics, the Americans amongst us politically embrace most of the ideals of the US Republican Party. Though we agree with many of Republican President Donald Trump's policies and actions, we do not feel he represents a pure Republican Party viewpoint. We are not aligned with the extremist views of the current Republican Party. Conservatism is opposed to extremism. To be more precise, we are aligned with a Ronald Reagan Era Republican Party of the 1980's that expressed more conservative ideals than does the current, more radical views of the Donald Trump Era Republican Party.</p>

<p>Pertaining to the current Republican Party, we are aligned with their stance on illegal immigration. No other country in the world allows a constant influx of illegal immigrants, who need only to make their way across the land borders into America, to live and work in the country. The leftist Democratic Party embraces this as immigrants pursuing the American Dream. In the meantime, natural born American citizens struggle to attain that same American Dream. We are aligned with the current Republican Party's dream of rebuilding American nationalism. Most countries around the world express their national pride and make laws that specifically protect the interests of their country. We are aligned with the current Republican Party's opposition against Wokeism, same sex marriage, the promotion of LGBTQ amongst children and teens, and other views that attack the traditional family or views and movements that stoke racial tension.</p>

<p>Though we do not align with some of the actions of President Donald Trump, we support him and many actions he has undertaken as the 47th President of the United States. Members of the Reich Family vote absentee in American elections. We are all registered to vote as Republicans. We will continue to vote for the Republican Party's nominations for President, Representative, or Senator. The Republican Party stands for most of our practices and political beliefs. The Reich Family is a religious group with strong political views on the protection of our right to practice our religion and the perpetuation of the traditional family that the Republican Party embraces, promotes, and protects.</p>

<div class="sectionheadings titlelinesheadings">Raising Our Children</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Our children are raised in a nurturing environment of love and guidance, as prescribed by our anointed Father. We teach our children that His Eminence Reich is their anointed earthly Father who loves them, teaches them, and protects them. We teach our children of the love and power of their Father. We teach our children how to pray to His Eminence who intercedes on their behalf to the Holy Trinity. They are taught that the Holy Trinity consists of Almighty God, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Our children are taught the Holy Scripture of the Old and New Testament. We teach our children to keep God's commandments. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2054%3A13&version=KJV" target="_blank">Isaiah 54:13</a> says, <span style="color:#008000;">And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children.</span> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%206%3A7&version=KJV" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 6:7</a> states, <span style="color:#008000;">And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2022%3A6&version=KJV" target="_blank">Proverbs 22:6</a> says, <span style="color:#008000;">Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</span> Our children are raised to honour and respect their biological mother and father. They are raised to honour and respect their anointed Father, His Eminence Reich. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020%3A12&version=KJV" target="_blank">Exodus 20:12</a> teaches, <span style="color:#008000;">Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</span> Our children are raised to respect and love their brothers, sisters, and friends. They are raised to be well behaved and show respect to their elders. We do not provoke our children with excessive discipline that might lead to their resentment of us as their parents and adult mentors. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206%3A4&version=KJV" target="_blank">Ephesians 6:4</a> states, <span style="color:#008000;">And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</span></p>

<p>Our young children are the most protected ones on earth. They are not sent alone amongst strangers in the outside world who might pose a danger to them. We academically teach our youngest children within our family. Starting in grade five, our children attend parochial schools in the community through grade twelve. This is not ideal for us. We hope to someday be financially capable to build our own schools and hire our own teachers to staff them. Our children and teens are our priority. We give them our very best. We live to take care of them, to love them, and to protect them.</p>

<div style="display:flex;">
<div id="comingofage" style="margin:auto;">
<div class="sectionheadings titlelinesheadings">Celebration of The Coming of Age</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The celebration of The Coming of Age takes place for girls at the age of twelve and for boys at the age of thirteen in the Reich Family. It is modelled after the Jewish tradition of Bat Mitzvah and Bar Mitzvah. The Reich Family's philosophies and celebrations of The Coming of Age for our youth are similar but not completely aligned with that of the Jewish religion. For instance, we regard girls to the same degree of importance as boys as it pertains to more serious roles in the Family after their Coming of Age.</p>

<p>The Jewish organisation Chabad explains, "Bat mitzvah is Hebrew for “daughter of commandment.” When a Jewish girl turns 12, she has all the rights and obligations of a Jewish adult, including the commandments of the Torah. From that date, she takes her place in the Jewish community. This milestone, called a bat mitzvah, is often celebrated with creative projects, meaningful gatherings and joyous parties," <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1918218/jewish/Bat-Mitzvah-What-It-Is-and-How-to-Celebrate.htm" target="_blank">Bat Mitzvah: What It Is and How to Celebrate a Jewish Girl's Coming of Age</a>.</p>

<p>The Jewish organisation Chabad continues, "Bar mitzvah is Hebrew for “son of commandment.” When a Jewish boy turns 13, he has all the rights and obligations of a Jewish adult, including the commandments of the Torah. From that date, he will wear tefillin on a daily basis, participate in synagogue services and take his place in the Jewish community. This milestone, called a bar mitzvah, is often celebrated with a ceremony in synagogue, tefillin wearing, and parties. The celebrant may be called to the Torah, lead services, deliver a speech or otherwise demonstrate his newfound status," <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1912609/jewish/Bar-Mitzvah-What-It-Is-and-How-to-Celebrate.htm" target="_blank">Bar Mitzvah: What It Is and How to Celebrate a Jewish Boy's Coming of Age</a>.</p>

<p>The Jewish organisation Chabad explains why the age of 12 is chosen for girls and the age of 13 is chosen for boys in the Jewish tradition of Bat Mitzvah and Bar Mitzvah. "Some explain that, like most other halachic measurements, the fact that the age of maturity is 12 or 13 is simply an oral tradition that God imparted to Moses on Mount Sinai (commonly called Halachah L’Moshe MiSinai). Others explain that this is derived from the Torah’s account of the destruction of the city of Shechem by Simeon and Levi in retaliation for the rape of their sister Dinah. The verse “On the third day, Jacob’s two sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each man took his sword and confidently attacked the city.” The term “man” (ish) is used to refer to both brothers, the younger of whom, Levi, was exactly 13 years old at the time. This is the youngest age at which someone is referred to as a “man” in the Torah; thus, we derive that the Torah considers a male of 13 years to be a man," <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2957494/jewish/Why-Are-Bar-and-Bat-Mitzvah-at-13-and-12.htm" target="_blank">Bar and Bat Mitzvah at 13 and 12</a>.</p>

<p>Chabad further explains, "Just as a boy is considered to be a man at the same time that he generally begins to experience physical maturity, a girl generally matures more quickly, and is therefore considered to be a woman earlier as well, i.e., when she turns 12 years old. According to some explanations in the Talmud, this feminine advantage can be inferred from the Torah’s description of the creation of the first woman, Eve: “The Lord God built the side that He had taken from man into a woman, and He brought her to man.” The word translated as “built,” vayiven, can also mean “and He gave her understanding,” implying that God created a woman in such a way that she reaches mental maturity earlier than a man," <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2957494/jewish/Why-Are-Bar-and-Bat-Mitzvah-at-13-and-12.htm" target="_blank">Bar and Bat Mitzvah at 13 and 12</a>.</p>

<p>The celebration of the Coming of Age is based on the Family's religious beliefs which are derived from the Judaic interpretation of certain passages in the Torah and the Talmud. Judaism is a respected religion that is closest to our own beliefs in its account of God, Whom we refer to as Almighty God. When a girl in the Reich Family turns 12, she has all the rights and obligations of an adult. When a boy in the Reich Family turns 13, he has all the rights and obligations of an adult. From that date, girls and boys take on serious roles and responsibilities in the Reich Family. Our youth recognise that they are now responsible for following the laws of the Reich Family, having reached the age of accountability for their actions and deeds. There is a higher expectation of their contributions to the Family. They now serve as positive role models for the children in the Reich Family. The Coming of Age is the start of the Family showing these wonderful young people the respect that is due them as young adults amongst us. Boys from the age of 13 and girls from the age of 12 have a strong voice in the governance of the Family. They are granted the power to vote on the most important issues, including the acceptance or rejection of new family members.</p>

<p id="vowofpurity">In a separate ceremony, subsequent to the celebration of the Coming of Age, our youth take the Vow of Purity which reads as follows. "I, (First Name) Reich, a faithful (Daughter or Son) of the Reich Family, vow to His Eminence Reich, to Almighty God, to my future spouse and to myself, to remain pure in mind and body for the spouse Almighty God has planned for me, so that when I enter the Sacrament of Matrimony, I will be able to give myself to (Him or Her) with a completely pure conscience. And if it should be that I should not marry, I vow to remain pure to honour the Teachings of His Eminence and to honour my Temple, which was created in the Image of Almighty God (Signed, Dated, Witnessed).

</div>
</div>

<p>A Vow of Purity would not be understood if our youth had never been educated in the area of human sexuality. Human sexuality education for our children and teens is based on the guidelines suggested by the Committee on Education of the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops and published in Human Sexuality - A Catholic Perspective for Education and Lifelong Learning [USCC, 1990]. We adhere to the teaching document from the Vatican by the Pontifical Council on the Family, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_08121995_human-sexuality_en.html" target="_blank">The Truth and Meaning of Human Sexuality: Guidelines for Education within the Family</a> of 1996. The following checklists for Reich Family parents, concerning what each age group should know about human sexuality, are categorized as <a href="https://files.ecatholic.com/5554/documents/2017/9/HO-SexChecklist%20YoungChilre.cwk%20WP.pdf?t=1504622395000" target="_blank">Early Childhood (Birth to Age 6)</a>, <a href="https://files.ecatholic.com/5554/documents/2017/9/HO-SexChecklist%20OlderChild.cwk%20WP.pdf?t=1505318243000" target="_blank">Childhood (Ages 7 to 11)</a>, <a href="https://files.ecatholic.com/5554/documents/2017/9/HO-SexChecklist%20YoungTeens.cwk%20WP.pdf?t=1505318134000" target="_blank">Early Adolescence (Ages 12 to 15)</a>, and <a href="https://files.ecatholic.com/5554/documents/2017/9/HO-SexChecklistOlderTeencwk.cwk%20WP.pdf?t=1504622458000" target="_blank">Adolescence (Ages 13 to 18)</a> (Courtesy of The Catholic Parishes in Waterloo, Faithful Parenting, St. John and St. Nicholas Religious Education Office, 1701 Mulberry Street, Waterloo IA 50703 and the <a href="https://waterloocatholics.org/catholic-parents-guide-to-formation-in-human-sexuality" target="_blank">Waterloo Catholic Faith Formation</a>). More details on the matter of human sexuality education in the Catholic Church can be found at the Catholic Education Resource Center in an article by Kenneth D. Whitehead titled, <a href="https://catholiceducation.org/en/marriage-and-family/sex-education-the-vatican-s-guidelines.html" target="_blank">Sex Education: The Vatican’s Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>To better understand these checklists concerning what each age group should know about human sexuality, we quote the <a href="https://waterloocatholics.org/catholic-parents-guide-to-formation-in-human-sexuality" target="_blank">Waterloo Catholic Faith Formation</a>: "Over and over again, the Church has emphasized the parent’s role as the “first herald” or "first witness" of faith for children.  This responsibility as your child’s “first teacher” is especially important in the area of human sexuality. Your child’s spiritual growth and formation in faith is closely connected to his or her general development as a human person.  As your child grows, it is important to provide not only adequate information about religious and moral teachings, but also the information they need to develop physically, socially, psychologically and emotionally. This guide is designed to help you provide the necessary information your child needs in order to develop as a healthy, mature, and morally responsible sexual person.  It outlines the general characteristics of sexual development at various ages from birth to adulthood, and provides guidelines for what children need to know about sexuality at various age levels. The developmental descriptions and guidelines are adapted from Human Sexuality - A Catholic Perspective for Education and Lifelong Learning, an official document prepared by the United States Catholic Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Committee on Education and approved by the Catholic bishops of the United States. (© 1991, United States Catholic Conference of Bishops)" The Reich Family uses this Catholic framework alongside the Pontifical Council on the Family, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_08121995_human-sexuality_en.html" target="_blank">The Truth and Meaning of Human Sexuality: Guidelines for Education within the Family</a> of 1996, released by the Vatican, to educate our children and teens in the area of human sexuality.</p>

<p>The Reich Family believes that human sexuality education of our children and teens is primarily our responsibility as parents. We also respect human sexuality education that is provided by the parochial schools our youth attend starting in grade five. We closely monitor what is being taught in each school our youth attend to make certain that they adhere to the guidelines mentioned above. Sex education programs, such as the ones in public schools in America, are not teaching teens to abstain from sexual activity. Their focus is to reduce the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases by promoting the usage of contraceptives. Abstinence is secondary in their teaching approach as a possible but not a reasonable option, assuming that teens will have sex regardless of how they are taught. We completely disagree with this assumption.</p>

<p>Human sexuality education is coupled with the moral implications of any sex act outside the Holy Bond of Matrimony. We teach our youth from 12 for girls and 13 for boys that sex outside of marriage is a grave sin and a violation of their human Temple, which we regard as an abomination to Almighty God in Whose Image they were created. We teach our youth who have Come of Age that a sex act is a sex act, whether committed with others or with one's self. They are taught that the definition of a sex act is not limited to consummation. The Catholic Catechism, which the Family is aligned with, states that “Fornication is gravely contrary to the dignity of persons and of human sexuality which is naturally ordered to the good of spouses and the generation and education of children” (CCC 2353). Our youth who have Come of Age understand all of this and have made a commitment to abstinence reflecting that understanding.</p>

<div style="display:flex;">
<div id="teensleavehome" style="margin:auto;">
<div class="sectionheadings titlelinesheadings">Youth Leave Home to Discover the World</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When our teens complete their secondary education and have chosen a path for their future, they are encouraged to leave the Realm of the Reich Family and attend university or pursue the lives of their choice. We provide as much career and university guidance as we can prior to their lives outside the Family. Whether university or two years of gap time for international travel, this is a time for our young adults to reflect on their religious upbringing in the Reich Family and decide if they wish to remain members of the Family and continue to embrace our religion or leave the Family and its religion behind. If our youth return to the Realm of the Family after university, or at any time in their lives after leaving us, we are so happy to have them back; however, any such return is their choice. If they wish to stay in the world outside the Realm of the Family, they are still loved and are welcomed to return to visit with any home or chapter within the Reich Family anytime they'd like.</p>

<p>The practice of encouraging our teens to leave the Family at the end of their secondary education for a Time of Reflection is distantly similar to one practiced by the Amish. Rumspringa is a rite of passage for Amish youth, typically starting at age 16, during which they are allowed to explore the outside world and experience behaviours that are usually restricted in their community. This period helps them make informed decisions about whether to commit to the Amish faith or leave the community altogether. Rumspringa is a Pennsylvania German combination of two high German words. Rum is <i><b>raum</i></b> in high German which means <b><i>space</i></b>. Springa is <i><b>spring</i></b> in high German which means <i><b>to jump</i></b>. Together, the term Rumspringa, in the high German literal sense, means to jump around in open space.</p>

<p>Unlike the Amish, the Reich Family is not a commune that is mostly insulated from the outside world. Unlike Amish youth, our teens have lived amongst non-Family members throughout their childhood and young adulthood. Starting from grade five, our children and teens attended school with other children and teens who were not members of the Reich Family or followers of our faith. Our teens have grown up in the religion practiced by the Family. They have been raised under the Divine Guidance of His Eminence and brought up by the care and guidance of their parents. For our teens, leaving home after secondary school is less of a Rumspringa and more of a Time of Reflection. We believe our teens need to be given an opportunity to go out into the world, away from their loving Family and its religion, so that they might make an informed decision on whether to return to the Family and be a part of us and our religion or leave the Family and make a way for themselves in life.</p>

<div style="display:flex;">
<div id="temple" style="margin:auto;">
<div class="sectionheadings titlelinesheadings">The Human Body is a Temple</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Reich Family believes the human body is a Temple that is a Gift from Almighty God in Whose Image we were created. We believe, as did the Apostle Paul, that we should glorify Almighty God in our body, and in our spirit, which belongs to Almighty God. The Temple consists of Mind, Body, and Soul. We strive to keep the Temple pure to allow the Holy Trinity to enter and reside within us. In the Apostle Paul’s first letter to the church in Corinth around 55 AD, he wrote in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I%20Corinthians%206%3A19-20&version=KJV" target="_blank">I Corinthians 6:19-20</a>, <span style="color:#008000;"><sup>19</sup> What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? <sup>20</sup> For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</span></p>

<p>The Apostle Paul rebuked the Corinthians over their method of settling law disputes outside the church and over the topic of incest. Paul insisted that their bodies were not their own but instead, belonged to Almighty God. Paul told the Corinthians they were bought with a price; a reference to Jesus Christ's death that paid for their sins. Paul wanted the church in Corinth to understand that they had no right to give their bodies over to impurities and sexual immorality. The same is true for us all today. The Family's belief, that our bodies are Temples, is aligned with the Apostle Paul's strong message to the Corinthians.</p>

<p>We honour the Temple of our bodies by presenting a wholesome outward image so that the world might witness our appreciation of Almighty God's Gift. We take special care of our outward physical appearance by dressing modestly and maintaining a healthy weight and a high level of personal hygiene. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20104%3A1&version=KJV" target="_blank">Psalm 104:1</a> says, <span style="color:#008000;"> Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.</span> We strive to clothe ourselves in splendour and majesty to reflect the Image of Almighty God. Our outward appearance represents the Family and His Eminence and must always be modestly presented at its very best. The human body is also very beautiful. We don't dress to cover what Almighty God has made in His Own Image. We see the Image of Almighty God as beautiful. We strive for outward beauty so that we might best represent Almighty God's beautiful Image.</p>

</figure>

<p>The Temple is violated when a person consumes food that is bad for their health. Junk food and other unhealthy foods that a person might consume is an attack on the Temple. The result of eating unhealthy food is obesity, sickness, and death. The Family does not eat meat, ultra processed food, highly sweetened food, or any other unhealthy food. Numerous health issues can occur from the consumption of meat. Why must one of Almighty God's creations be consumed? In opposition, we consume vegetables instead of meat; eat healthy foods that are nutrient dense; get proper exercise, adequate sleep, and maintain a healthy weight.</p>

<p>To respect the outward image and health of the Temple, we practice moderation in the consumption of food. Moderation is not easy in a world where excessiveness is promoted. Those who eat in excess are guilty of the sin of Gluttony which is one of the seven deadly sins, according to the monk Evagrius Ponticus and refined by Pope Gregory the Great, the 64th Bishop of Rome and Head of the Roman Catholic Church from 590 to 604. If a person gains massive weight into the many hundreds of pounds, it is outwardly evident that they have violated the Temple. We see this as a self-inflicted distortion of Almighty God's original Image that was gifted to them on the day of their birth.</p>

<p>Excessive alcohol consumption, drugs whether prescription or otherwise, smoking or vaping, and pornography are just a few examples of things that violate the purity of the Temple. We do not consume alcohol in excess. We refrain from the usage of all drugs, unless absolutely necessary. Alcohol and drug abuse lead to death. Psychiatric drugs that are prescribed by psychiatrists and general practitioners violate the Temple with severe side effects. Pornography is poison to the Mind, a mighty component of the Temple. Pornography can lead to acting out a sex act outside the Holy Bond of Matrimony or the encouragement to engage in a self sex act that is just as impure to the Temple.</p>

<p>We believe that a person can defile their Temple with the words that proceed from their mouths. Words can hurt one's self as well as others. Words should never be underestimated for the disastrous effects they can have. Unclean words, such as vulgarity and any other expletive language, defiles the Temple. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201%3A26&version=KJV" target="_blank">James 1:26</a> says, <span style="color:#008000;">If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</span> We believe that the words that proceed from the Temple represent the Family, His Eminence, and Almighty God. We are mindful of every word that proceeds from the Temple, whether orally said or in written form.</p>

<p>We do not defile the Temple with sexual sins, which includes any sex act outside of the Holy Bond of Matrimony. Sexual acts with others outside marriage is a sin and well understood to be so; however, self violation of the Temple is just as sinful. If impure sexual thoughts violate the purity of the Temple, a sex act with one's self is even more of a violation. It is true that a self sex act does not hurt others but it does hurt one's self. Impure thoughts are as serious as a sex act. If you harbour thoughts of sexual fantasies, you have defiled the purity of the Mind. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A27-28&version=KJV" target="_blank">Matthew 5:27-28</a> says, <span style="color:#008000;"><sup>27</sup> Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: <sup>28</sup> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</span> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2023%3A7&version=KJV" target="_blank">Proverbs 23:7</a> states, <span style="color:#008000;">For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he.</span> Your thoughts define you. Sexual fantasies are highly dangerous and most unclean. Sexual fantasies can lead to acting out those fantasies in real life with devastating and sometimes deadly results.</p>

<p>We respect the sanctity and preservation of the Temples of others. Any person who violates the Temple of another has committed a grave sin. The most serious example is the violation of the Temple of a Child, through a sex act, a physically abusive act, or murder. A child is the most Pure and Perfect Temple amongst us. The one who commits such a violation against a child is at the Mercy of Almighty God's Vengeance. Whether this person faces judgment in this life or in the next, a reckoning will eventually come. The consequences for violating the Purity of the Temple of a Child are the most severe of all. A deplorable sex act starts with a fantasy that has defiled the offender's Temple long before they violate the Precious and Pure Temple of a Child. This is why all offenses against the Temple are to be taken very seriously, whether by thought or by deed.</p>

<div id="psychiatry" style="margin:auto;">
<div class="sectionheadings titlelinesheadings">Our Opposition to Psychiatry</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="read-more-wrapper">

<p>The Reich Family is strongly opposed to the psychiatric profession, similar to the anti-psychiatry stance expressed by the Church of Scientology. We view psychiatry as a detriment to society and a pseudo science that offers no cures. The pharmaceutical side of psychiatry is a multi-billion dollar industry for big pharma along with psychiatrists and general practitioners who prescribe what we consider, poison. Psychiatrists and general practitioners distribute highly addictive drugs with unreal side effects that include suicidal and homicidal tendencies. A patient comes to their psychiatrist or general practitioner for help and are instead given drugs that lead to addiction and a host of side effects that cause their single problem to compound into a massive nightmare.</p>

<p>In an article by the Church of Scientology titled, <a href="https://www.scientology.org/faq/scientology-in-society/why-is-scientology-opposed-to-psychiatric-abuses.html" target="_blank">Why is Scientology Opposed to Psychiatric Abuses</a>, they write, "In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, mentally troubled patients were literally subjected to torture devices. Next it was ice baths and insulin shock. Then electroconvulsive therapy that caused broken teeth and bones as well as loss of memory and regression into comatose states. Next, it was prefrontal lobotomies with an ice pick through the eye socket. Today it is drugs." The Family fully agrees with this assessment. It is as if the world has some form of amnesia when it comes to the historical atrocities of the psychiatric profession that ran asylums until US President Ronald Reagan closed them in the 1980's. It might not have been quite as horrible as the experiments of Nazi Doctor Joseph Mengele but it was bad enough to be held against the psychiatric profession for good.</p>

<p>We believe that psychiatric labels twist a person's fate. It alters their lives to revolve around a label that psychiatry changes every few years at their politically correct whim. Lifetime psychiatric labels also give the recipient no hope of making a change in their lives. No person should be deprived of the ability to change or transform their lives because they have been given a debilitating psychiatric label and convinced by psychiatry that the label applies to them for the rest of their lives. The Family sees the marketing effort of psychiatry in ruining the lives of American youth who are searching for an identity. Psychiatry offers youth a psychiatric disorder label they can identify with that will last them for a lifetime of defeat.</p>

<p>The psychiatric label Autism once had a specific meaning in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. There was a set of criterion that the patient had to meet to be diagnosed with Autism. Eventually, psychiatry decided that such labels as Mildly/Moderately/Severely Retarded were not politically correct. They decided to take the specific diagnosis of Autism and create a "one size fits all" label known as Autistic Spectrum Disorder. The mental differences in patients who receive this label are vast. Irresponsibly, psychiatry loosely diagnoses a person as "being on the spectrum."</p>

<p>Whatever the label, recipients take them very seriously. A label means government assistance, a possible lifetime in a group home setting or psych ward, a lifetime of abusive and addictive drugs, and worse. What society once referred to using such terms as 'off colour behaviour' or 'a bit strange', is now given the psychiatric label, Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Non-specific diagnoses are prohibitive in the world of medicine but psychiatry is not medicine. A person's life depends on a diagnosis. Special treatment applies to specialised diagnoses in the world of medicine, not some blanket diagnosis with no specific treatment.</p>

<p>Our approach to mental health is rooted in the Reich Family’s Trinitarian faith, the peace and comfort found in he Family’s Holy Writings, and the conviction that the human body is a temple. Prayer and Holy Writings are the primary means by which members are reoriented and supported. Physical wellbeing is inseparable from mental health. Bodily stewardship affirms that the human body must be honoured through healthy choices such as nourishing food, adequate sleep, regular physical activity and the avoidance of substances that impair the body and mind. Family support provides structures through which care and guidance are delivered. Trusted relatives and teachers within the Family offer support, companionship, and guidance. Decisions about a member’s care are made within the Family’s governance and moral framework. Crisis stabilization emphasizes immediate nonmedical measures to restore calm, safety and routine. In acute distress the Family prioritizes voluntary, nonmedical support focused on safety and consent. With the person’s agreement we assist them in leaving harmful environments and offer a calm private place to recuperate. We ensure rest and basic needs, maintain continuous presence by trusted family members, and help restore regular spiritual and everyday life routines as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We consider psychotropic medications poisonous to the brain; therefore, they are not used within the Family for mental and emotional distress. We are not opposed to medications that stabilize conditions that are clearly physical in origin when those conditions are demonstrably localized to the brain. Therapies that restore or preserve brain function are acceptable within our doctrine. Examples include antiepileptic medications for seizure disorders and antimicrobials or antivirals for central nervous system infections such as meningitis or encephalitis. They also include thrombolytics and anticoagulants used acutely for ischemic stroke, medications to reduce intracranial pressure, and disease-specific therapies for neurodegenerative disorders that directly target brain pathology. These interventions are distinct from psychotropic medications used to manage mental or behavioral conditions and are considered compatible with our teaching that the body is a temple. We reject psychotropic medications as a primary approach to mental and emotional distress. Honouring the body means choosing nourishing food, abstaining from meat and ultra-processed products, maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in regular physical activity, getting adequate sleep, and avoiding intoxicants and other substances that impair the body and mind.</p>

<p>The Reich Family holds the same views as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS or The Mormons) as to the importance of genealogical research. The <a href="https://reich.tf/research" target="_blank">Reich Family Genealogical Research Project</a> serves as a depository for genealogical records, historical accounts, and memories of those who have passed. Genealogical research is conducted thoroughly using such resources as FamilySearch.org, JewishGEN, and more. The Reich Family writes articles and memorials based on research documents that include but are not limited to: census records, marriage records, death certificates, military records, naturalization papers, ship manifests, and more. All memorials and articles are private and are intended only for family members and fellow researchers unless otherwise decided to be of great importance to the public historical record.</p>

<p>Amongst those articles of great importance to the public historical record are our articles for Maria Katsaris and her father. Maria was a me</p>

<p>Our beloved Reich has endured an event similar to that of the scorn, ridicule, hatred, and abuse of Jesus prior to the crucifixion. We are ever vigilant of a possible Judas Iscariot amongst us, who might try to hand over our beloved Reich to the authorities to be hauled away in chains, much as Jesus was arrested and ultimately handed over to the Romans, leading to his conviction and crucifixion. As long as the Reich Family is alive and strong, we will prevent our anointed leader from a horrible fate. Unfortunately, we are without our beloved leader at times when he must be separated from us and hidden away. This is for the protection of Reich but also for the protection of the Family. During these times of distance from us, he suffers in complete isolation without the loving embrace of His Family, who is likewise deprived of the presence of His Eminence.</p>

<p>We are the Family of Reich, our anointed earthly Father, whom we dearly love and deeply respect as the Supreme Head of the Reich Family. We rely upon the guidance and teachings of His Eminence. We are immersed in the body of our family, allowing us to express our eternal love and loyalty, one to another. We pray that His Eminence, Blessed and Powerful, will intercede on our behalf to Almighty God, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, that the Holy Trinity might grant us a good and pure life of happiness; to forgive us of our sins; and to grant us eternal life. Through the Infinite Wisdom of His Eminence Reich, the way is paved.</p>
