<p style="text-align:center;color:#EFEFEF;" class="toptitle"><b>The Jewishness of Polly Hannah Klaas</b></p>

<p style="font-family:Montserrat-ExtraLightItalic;line-height:1.5;">In modern Rabbinic Judaism, the traditional method of determining Jewishness relies on tracing one's maternal line. According to halakha, the recognition of someone as fully Jewish requires them to have been born to a Jewish mother (Mishnah Kidushin 3:12; Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEzer 8:5). Polly Hannah's memory should focus on her wonderful life and incredible Jewish heritage - not on the horrible crime that took her from her loving family and friends.</p>

<p><b>(REICH)</b> 10/15/24 - Polly Hannah Klaas was born on January 3<sup>rd</sup> 1981 in Fairfax, Marin County, California to Marc Klaas and Eve Reed Klaas. Polly's mother later divorced Marc Klaas and remarried Alan Nichol. Polly Hannah lived most of her life in Petaluma California with her biological sister, Annie Nichol, and her stepsister, Jess Nichol.</p>

<p>On October 1<sup>st</sup> 1993, twelve year old Polly Hannah Klaas was abducted from her Petaluma home. A grand search was conducted for two months to bring Polly Hannah home to her family. On November 30th 1993, Richard Allen Davis was arrested for a parole violation. On December 4th 1993, over two months after Polly Klaas was abducted, Davis led investigators to her remains in Cloverdale California - forty-eight miles north of her home in Petaluma.</p>

<p>Recently, Polly Hannah's grandfather, <a href="eugenereed" target="_blank">Dr Eugene Reed</a>, was brought to my attention by another researcher, Barnett. He had discovered that Dr Reed's original last name was Rosenberg. As a genealogist located in Europe, I was immediately very interested in the Jewish heritage of Polly Hannah's maternal lineage. I came to learn that Dr Eugene Reed had an incredible life and made amazing contributions to society. What a brilliant man he was. Eugene and Joan's courage in escaping the Holocaust in Europe is one of survival and inspiration.</p>

<p>I have conducted matrilineal genealogical research on the grandparents and ending with the great grandparents of Polly Hannah Klaas. The theme of my research was one of establishing her Jewish heritage. I have published my findings for members of families Rosenberg, Wallach, Gr√ºnfeld, and Hostovsky.</p>

<p>What follows are the family lines of Polly Hannah's grandparents, <a href="eugenereed" target="_blank">Dr Eugene Rosenberg Reed</a> and Joan Gr√ºnfeld Reed. The family lineage of Polly Hannah's grandfather bears the heading <b><i>Familie Rosenberg</i></b>. The family lineage of Polly Hannah's grandmother bears the heading <b><i>Familie Gr√ºnfeld</i></b>.</p>

<p><b><i>EVE REED (Polly's Mother - Familie Rosenberg-Reed)</i></b> - Eve Reed was born in 23 February 1949 in Brooklyn New York to Dr Eugene Reed and Hannerl Joan Josefine Gr√ºnfeld Reed. In the 1950 U.S. Census, one year old Eve(n)lyn lived with her parents, Eugene Reed and Hannerl Joan Josefine Gr√ºnfeld Rosenberg Reed, in the home of her grandparents, Markus Rosenberg and Taube Toni Wallach Rosenberg.</p>

<p>At 28 years old, Eve Reed married Marc Klaas in San Francisco California in 1977. They had one daughter. Polly Hannah Klaas was born on January 3<sup>rd</sup> 1981 in Fairfax, Marin County, California to Marc Klaas and Eve Reed Klaas. Eve later divorced Marc Klaas. Eve met Alan Nichol because her daughter Polly Hannah had befriended Nichol's daughter Jess in the local park. Eve later married Polly Hannah's playmate's father, Alan Nichol. At that time, Eve lived in Petaluma California. Eve and Alan Nichol had a biological daughter named Annie Nichol - the half-sister of Polly Hannah Klaas.</p>

<p><b><i>DR EUGENE ROSENBERG REED (Polly's Grandfather - Familie Rosenberg-Reed)</i></b> - Eugene Reed was born Eugene Rosenberg on 12 October 1919, in Vienna Austria, to Markus Rosenberg and Taube (Toni) Wallach Rosenberg. He had a brother named Edward Rosenberg who was born on 30 January 1923 in Vienna Austria.</p>

<p>Eugene's father, Markus Rosenberg, was born on February 22nd 1884 in Woloczysak Russia. Eugene's mother was born Taube Wallach on January 18th 1893, in Podwoloczysk Poland. Markus Rosenberg married Taube Wallach at the Jewish temple Milit√§rseelsorge on January 24th 1918 in Vienna Austria. Markus and Taube (Toni) immigrated to the United States on October 28th 1940. They were naturalized as US citizens on 23 October 1941.</p>

<p>In the 1950 US Census, Eugene and Joan Reed lived with Eugene's parents and their one year old daughter, Eve, in the upstairs apartment at 1523 Union Street, Brooklyn New York. Eugene's father Markus Rosenberg was listed as the head of the house. The granddaughters of Eugene and Joan Reed, were Polly Hannah Klaas and Annie Nichol.

<p><b><i>HANNERL JOSEFINE JOAN GR√úNFELD (Polly's Grandmother - Familie Gr√ºnfeld-Rosenberg)</i></b> - Hannerl Josefine Gr√ºnfeld was born in Vienna Austria on January 4th 1920 to Dr Rudolf Gr√ºnfeld and Ida Hostovsky Gr√ºnfeld. Hannerl's parents, Dr Rudolf Gr√ºnfeld and Ida Hostovsky, were married in Vienna Austria on 7 February at the Jewish temple named, Stadttempel. Hannerl had one sister. Ruth Harriet Gr√ºnfeld was born 29 October 1911 in Vienna Austria. Ruth married Dr Ernest Freed. Hannerl was a pianist. She was listed as a dressmaker when she immigrated to the United States. Hannerl, then called Joan, married Eugene Rosenberg in London England on May 17th 1942. Joan and Eugene left Vienna Austria to escape German persecution of the Jews during WWII. They left with Eugene's parents, Markus and Taube along with Eugene's brother Edward and immigrated to England, living in London. Joan and Eugene immigrated from Liverpool England to the United States on November 29th 1943, arriving in Boston Massachusetts on the ship, Empress of Australia. They were naturalized as US citizens on 29 January 1944. They lived in Brooklyn New York at 1523 Union Street with Eugene's parents - Markus and Taube (Toni) Rosenberg. The couple later changed their last name from Rosenberg to Reed. Joan and Eugene Reed had a daughter named Evenlyn, known as Eve. Joan's granddaughters were Polly Hannah Klaas and Annie Nichol. Eugene and Joan retired to their favorite vacation spot, the Monterey Peninsula, decades before their deaths, settling in Pebble Beach, California.</p>

<p><b><i>DR RUDOLF GR√úNFELD (Polly's Great Grandfather - Familie Gr√ºnfeld)</i></b> - Rudolf Gr√ºnfeld was born in Tesin, Okres Jiƒç√≠n, Hradec Kralove, Czechia to Markus Gr√ºnfeld and Josefine Neumann Gr√ºnfeld on 8 November 1877. Dr Rudolf Gr√ºnfeld married Ida Hostovsky on 7 February 1909 in Vienna Austria at the Jewish temple, Stadttempel. Dr Rudolf Gr√ºnfeld and Ida Hostovsky Gr√ºnfeld had two daughters. Ruth Harriet Gr√ºnfeld was born 29 October 1911 in Vienna Austria. Ruth married Dr Ernest Freed. Hannerl Josefine Gr√ºnfeld was born 4 January 1920 in Vienna Austria. Hannerl married Eugene (Rosenberg) Reed.</p>

<p><b><i>IDA HOSTOVSKY GR√úNFELD (Polly's Great Grandmother - Familie Hostovsky-Gr√ºnfeld)</i></b> - Ida Hostovsky was born in Nachod, Okres N√°chod, Hradec Kralove, Czechia to Moriz Hostovsky and Therese Bayer Hostovsky on 28 February 1883. Ida Hostovsky married Rudolf Gr√ºnfeld on 7 February 1909 in Vienna Austria at the Jewish temple, Stadttempel. Ida Hostovsky Gr√ºnfeld and Dr Rudolf Gr√ºnfeld had two daughters. Ruth Harriet Gr√ºnfeld was born 29 October 1911 in Vienna Austria. Ruth married Dr Ernest Freed. Hannerl Josefine Gr√ºnfeld was born 4 January 1920 in Vienna Austria. Hannerl married Eugene (Rosenberg) Reed.</p>

<p><b><i>RUTH HARRIET GR√úNFELD FREED (Polly's Great Aunt - Familie Gr√ºnfeld)</i></b> - Ruth Harriet Gr√ºnfeld was born in Vienna Austria on October 29th 1911 to Dr Rudolf Gr√ºnfeld and Ida Hostovsky Gr√ºnfeld. Ruth's parents, Dr Rudolf Gr√ºnfeld and Ida Hostovsky, were married in Vienna Austria on 7 February at the Jewish temple named, Stadttempel. Ruth had one sister. Hannerl Josefine Gr√ºnfeld was born 4 January 1920 in Vienna Austria. Hannerl married Eugene (Rosenberg) Reed. Ruth Harriet Gr√ºnfeld married Dr Ernest Freed. Ruth and Ernest were later divorced. Ruth Harriet Gr√ºnfeld Freed died on 12 February 1970 in hospital at 225 Hawthorne Road in Winston-Salem North Carolina. Her remains were cremated and buried at Forsyth Memorial Park in Winston-Salem North Carolina. Frank Vogler & Sons Mortuary in Winston-Salem was in charge of her services. Note: Though her tombstone and death certificate states her date of birth as 1912, two separate birth records prove that her actual year of birth was 1911.</p>

<p>According to my research, Polly's mother Eve's parents, Eugene Rosenberg Reed and Hannerl Joan Gr√ºnfeld Rosenberg Reed, were both Jewish - proven further by the parents of Eugene and Joan who were also Jewish. Therefore, Polly's mother Eve is Jewish on both her paternal and maternal side.</p>

<p>In modern Rabbinic Judaism, the traditional method of determining Jewishness relies on tracing one's maternal line. According to halakha, the recognition of someone as fully Jewish requires them to have been born to a Jewish mother (Mishnah Kidushin 3:12; Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEzer 8:5). Therefore, according to Jewish law, Polly Hannah was fully Jewish.</p>

<p>It is because of Polly Hannah Klaas that I am even aware of her grandfather which inspired me to conduct my research on her matrilineal Jewish genealogy. Polly Hannah's memory should focus on her wonderful life and incredible Jewish heritage - not on the horrible crime that took her from her loving family and friends.</p>
